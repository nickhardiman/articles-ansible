Playbook creates a bootable customized Kickstart ISO file. 

I wrote something similar for my Summit talk.

playbook

== why 

Worth doing this? 

=== pros 

More in keeping with the automation vibe


=== cons 

More grief than clicking through the graphical installer

Requires a working Ansible env on the workstation


== build 

Like
https://github.com/nickhardiman/summit_OD1226/blob/main/ansible_playbooks/iso_build/main.yml
but use Red Hat CDN.
