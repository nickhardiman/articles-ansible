== don't change platform-python

The OS comes with its own copy of Python. 
This is not meant for users.  
If Python experts customize this copy, they could break system tools. 

You can get away with installing some things without doing damage to system python. For instance, running the command ``sudo /usr/libexec/platform-python3.6 -m pip install ansible-lint`` would add a useful tool to your Ansible toolbox. But it's a bad habit.
