Use ansible tools.

The _ansible_ package installs a bunch of utilities in /usr/bin/. 

This list includes both user tools and developer tools.

common user tools

. https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html[ansible-playbook] runs playbooks on a control node and pushes code to managed nodes
. https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-vault.html[ansible-vault] for storing encrypted secrets

more user tools

== utilities 

Each utility has its own page in the system administration manual. 
Run `man ansible` to view the first one. 

This is the Python script that helps users. 

* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible.html[ansible] - run a task 

These are aliases for the Ansible utility.
In other words, they are symlinks to the Python script. 
The script behaves differently depending on how it is called. 

* ansible-config - view configuration 
* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-console.html[ansible-console] - run a task interactively, for debugging 
* ansible-doc - 
* ansible-galaxy
* ansible-inventory
* ansible-playbook
* ansible-pull
* ansible-vault

This Python script is for Ansible to use, not people. It has no man page.

* ansible-connection
