== GitHub REST API

These examples use data obtained from the GitHub 
https://docs.github.com/en/rest[REST API]. 

Open the URL https://api.github.com/repos/prometheus/prometheus/releases/latest to see JSON like this. 

This is a fake example, with most fields removed. 
The real content is much bigger.

== the Cloud Alchemy way

How Cloud Alchemy guys do it. 

This code is based on their work. 
The Cloud Alchemy role is here. 

* https://galaxy.ansible.com/cloudalchemy/prometheus
* https://github.com/cloudalchemy/ansible-prometheus/

Get latest release details from GitHub and extract a couple values.

[source,YAML]
----
- name: Get latest release
  uri:
    url: "https://api.github.com/repos/prometheus/prometheus/releases/latest"
    method: GET
    return_content: true
    status_code: 200
    body_format: json
    validate_certs: false
  register: _latest_release
  until: _latest_release.status == 200
  retries: 5
 
- name: "Set prometheus version to {{ _latest_release.json.tag_name[1:] }}"
  set_fact:
    prometheus_version: "{{ _latest_release.json.tag_name[1:] }}"
----


Get the matching SHA256 checksum. 

[source,YAML]
----
# get latest release SHA256 checksum from GitHub
- name: "Get checksum list"
  set_fact:
    __prometheus_checksums: "{{ lookup('url', 'https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v' + prometheus_version + '/sha256sums.txt', wantlist=True) | list }}"
 
- name: "Get checksum for and64 architecture"
  set_fact:
    __prometheus_checksum: "{{ item.split(' ')[0] }}"
  with_items: "{{ __prometheus_checksums }}"
  when:
    - "('linux-amd64.tar.gz') in item"
----


=== download 

Download the archive of binaries from GitHub. 
For an alternative approach, see GitHub's command line tool  https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_release_download[gh]. 

[source,YAML]
----
- name: prometheus: download archive
  become: false
  get_url:
    url: "https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v{{ prometheus_version }}/prometheus-{{ prometheus_version }}.linux-amd64.tar.gz"
    dest: "/tmp/prometheus-{{ prometheus_version }}.linux-amd64.tar.gz"
    checksum: "sha256:{{ __prometheus_checksum }}"
----


== use jq to get  the download URL 

Get the download URL using the jq tool. 

jq looks for the last part of the file name, _linux-amd64.tar.gz_.

[source,YAML]
----
# get latest release download URL from GitHub (redundant)
- name: prometheus: install supporting packages
  ansible.builtin.yum:
    name: jq
    state: latest
 
- name: prometheus: get latest release info from GitHub
  ansible.builtin.get_url:
    url: https://api.github.com/repos/prometheus/prometheus/releases/latest
    dest: /var/tmp/latest.json
 
# jq select fun
- name: prometheus: extract browser_download_url from release info
  ansible.builtin.command:
    cmd: >
      jq --raw-output
      '.assets[] | select(.name|match("linux-amd64.tar.gz$")) | .browser_download_url'
      /var/tmp/latest.json
  register: r_jq
 
- debug:
    msg: "download {{ r_jq['stdout'] }}"
